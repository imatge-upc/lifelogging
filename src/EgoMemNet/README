The provided model is a fine-tuned version of MemNet (MIT) trained on a set of egocentric images. The provided model is in the Caffe format (http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/).
This model can be downloaded in the link provided in the main README.
Using 10 crops per image, the model achieves a rank correlation of 0.83 on the test data. 

We also provide the mean file and the train/deploy prototxts of the model. 
There are two versions of train prototxt, for different data inputs.
